# TODO

There are tons of ways we'd like to extend Blogit, offering more and more value. Unfortunately development takes time, so we're not able to do everything all at once. 

Here are a few of the things on our TODO list.

Each of these TODOs should have its own issue on Github so you can leave us your thoughts too.

## [Support for image uploads](https://github.com/KatanaCode/blogit/issues/67)

This is our next top priority. We want to be able to add multiple images to blog posts and integrate this with Carrierwave.
