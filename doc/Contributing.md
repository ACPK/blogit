# Blogit Contribution guidelines

## Assessing the demand

We don't want you to waste your time on updates that are never merged. If you have an idea for a new feature or a bug fix, please open an issue first. 

## Make the changes locally

Once the updates you've suggested have been agreed, please fork the repo and make your changes on your own repo.

## Submit a pull request

Once you're happy with your updates, run the tests to make sure they still pass. Commit, and submit a pull request on GitHub.
